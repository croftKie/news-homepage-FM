## Overview

My project creates a news homepage that displays "hero" content, as well as "New" content and a "top 3" section.

The project is both desktop and mobile friendly and provides interactive elements for hover and active functions as well as a mobile menu system that is stick upon scroll.

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Provide an easy-to-adjust format using CSS Grid.
